before running anything make sure you have installed required python modules,
you can do this by entering the directory in which the script files are saved
and then installing the requirements by running:   
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
then:
```
pip install -r req.txt
```
If you don't have python installed you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/).
